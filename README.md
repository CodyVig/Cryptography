# Cryptography
Archive of important cryptographic code written during the Math 116 course at UC Berkeley in Fall 2021.

Math 116 is an upper-division undergraduate course on mathematical cryptography. Code was written to implement cryptosystems discussed in class. The most important cryptosystems discussed were RSA and various implementations of Elliptic Curve ElGamal (e.g., MV ElGamal). The code suppled here can be used to generate keys and encrypt/decrypt messages.
